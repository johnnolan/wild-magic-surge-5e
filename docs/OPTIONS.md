# Options

## Wild Magic Surge Mode

Choose between the following options to track your Wild Magic Surges

- **Default**: On a roll of `1`, trigger a Wild Magic Surge (Default and can be configured in the Dice Formula options)
- **Incremental Check**: Every time a spell is cast, the threshold is increased by `1` for a Surge. Once triggered the threshold is reset back to `1`.
- **Incremental Check (Chaotic)**: For the amazingly awesome chaotic players and GMs. Instead of increasing every time a spell is cast, at the start of every turn in combat, the threshold is increased by `1` for a Surge to a maximum of `10`. Once triggered the threshold is reset back to `1`.
- **Spell Level Dependent Rolls**: Wild Magic Surge triggers dependent on spell level (Set options below).

Based on your settings, it will show a prompt that a `Wild Magic Surge` has occured or not.

This message is configurable should you wish.

## The target result of the dice roll

## Auto surge on spell use after Tides of Chaos has been used

When Tides of Chaos is used, any 1st level spell and higher will trigger a surge and restore your Tides of Chaos.

## Setup varying Wild Magic Surge triggers dependent on spell level

Adds the ability to set your own roll evaluation dependent on the spell level used.

For example

- A lvl 1 spell only triggers wild magic if a 1 is rolled on the d20
- A lvl 4 spell triggers if a 4 or lower is rolled
- A lvl 9 triggers if a 9 or lower is rolled

## Spell Regex for Multiclass spells

The RegEx to differentiate between sorcerer spells and non sorcerer spells. This assumes the sorcerer spells to be renamed like `Magic Missile (S)`. Special characters must be escaped!

## Play animation on Surge

On a Wild Magic Surge, the token that triggered the Surge will get an animation play. This requires the awesome [https://github.com/fantasycalendar/FoundryVTT-Sequencer](Sequencer) and [https://github.com/Jules-Bens-Aa/JB2A_DnD5e](JB2A) modules to be installed and active.
