## Setup Guides

Below is a list of links to help you setup the module and your Player Characters.

- [Using built in Hooks](./docs/HOOKS.md)

## Top Level Features

- **Default**: On a roll of 1, trigger a Wild Magic Surge (Default and can be configured in the Dice Formula options)
- **Incremental Check**: Every time a spell is cast, the threshold is increased by `1` for a Surge. Once triggered the threshold is reset back to `1`.
- **Incremental Check (Chaotic)**: For the amazingly awesome chaotic players and GMs. Instead of increasing every time a spell is cast, at the start of every turn in combat, the threshold is increased by `1` for a Surge to a maximum of `10`. Once triggered the threshold is reset back to `1`.
- **Spell Level Dependent Rolls**: [Wild Magic Surge triggers dependent on spell level. Click here for more option details.](./docs/SPELL_LEVEL_DEPENDENT.md)
- **Descending Dice**: On no Surge roll `d20`, `d12`, `d10`, `d8`, `d6` then `d4` until a surge, then reset back to `d20`.
- **Barbarian - Path of Wild Magic - Tasha's Cauldron of Everything**: When you enter a Rage as a Wild Magic Barbarian, the module will auto roll on a table. [For setup instructions see the documentation here](./docs/POWN_BARB.md).

[![Whisper chat results to GM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnolan/wild-magic-surge-5e/main/images/whisper-chat.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnolan/wild-magic-surge-5e/main/images/whisper-chat.jpg)

### Auto Roll a check for Wild Magic Surge instead of just a reminder to roll

The additional option `Auto Roll for a Wild Magic Surge instead of just the prompt` will auto roll in the background for you and post the result in the Chat.

Based on your settings, it will show a prompt that a `Wild Magic Surge` has occured or not.

This message is configurable should you wish.

### Send Incremental Check charge to chat

When enabled, each time a incremental check for a surge changes it is posted to Chat for others to see.

[![Send Incremental Check charge to chat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnolan/wild-magic-surge-5e/main/images/increment-chat.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnolan/wild-magic-surge-5e/main/images/increment-chat.jpg)

### Enable Auto Roll on a Wild Magic Surge Table

Choose how to auto roll on a Wild Magic Surge Table.

1. None - This won't do any auto rolling on a table
2. Auto Roll Table - This will automatically roll for the player and display the roll table results
3. Player Trigger Roll - Will prompt in the Wild Magic Surge message for the Player to click a button to roll on the table and display the results.

You can configure a Custom Roll Table by replacing the default name in the settings with your own version.

### Execute a GM Macro on a Wild Magic Surge

When a surge happens you can specify your own macro to run. Note this will only trigger a macro setup on the GM user.

Included is a compendium containing examples and the javascript for them are in [/scripts/macros](scripts/macros/).

[![Execute a GM Macro on a Wild Magic Surge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnolan/wild-magic-surge-5e/main/images/macro-surge.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnolan/wild-magic-surge-5e/main/images/macro-surge.jpg)

### Trigger a Wild Magic Surge from your own Macro

If you want to trigger a Wild Magic Surge from your own Macro, you can call the built in hook `wild-magic-surge-5e.manualTriggerWMS` and pass the actor with it.

This feature will allow you to customise to your own preferences, what triggers the Wild Magic Surge.

#### Example macro code

- Select the token on the canvas you want to run the Wild Magic Surge for
- Click your macro with the token still selected
- The module will trigger a Wild Magic Surge on that actor if a roll on 1d20 is less than 3

``` js

// Create new roll object
let roll = new Roll("1d20");

// Roll the dice
await roll.evaluate({async: false});

// If total is less than 3 (i.e. less than 10%)
if (roll.total < 3) {
  // Trigger a wild magic surge passing the selected actor and roll
  Hooks.callAll(`wild-magic-surge-5e.manualTriggerWMS`, actor, roll);
}


```

Doing this will automatically trigger the Wild Magic Surge logic you have set up.

### Tides of Chaos Recharge

Another option allows you to recharge `Tides of Chaos` automatically on a `Wild Magic Surge`.

[![Tides of Chaos Recharge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnolan/wild-magic-surge-5e/main/images/tides-of-chaos.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnolan/wild-magic-surge-5e/main/images/tides-of-chaos.jpg)

### Dice Formula

Set a custom dice formula you want to roll to check for a `Wild Magic Surge`. The default is `1d20`.

[![Dice Formula](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnolan/wild-magic-surge-5e/main/images/dice-formula.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnolan/wild-magic-surge-5e/main/images/dice-formula.jpg)

### Track Wild Magic Surge for NPCs

Enabling this setting will automate Wild Magic Surge for Non Player Characters as well as Player Characters. Ensure the NPC has the `Wilg Magic Surge` feat.

[![Dice Formula](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnolan/wild-magic-surge-5e/main/images/track-npcs.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnolan/wild-magic-surge-5e/main/images/track-npcs.jpg)

### The target result of the dice roll

What is the dice roll result you want to check against. The default is `1`.

Can also set multiple target results using a comma seperated value list like `1, 3, 5, 10, 19`

[![The target result of the dice roll](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnolan/wild-magic-surge-5e/main/images/target-result-dice-roll.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnolan/wild-magic-surge-5e/main/images/target-result-dice-roll.jpg)

### Roll result boolean expression

Based on the target dice roll, should the result be less/greater than or equal to the result to trigger the `Wild Magic Surge`. The default is `=`.

[![Roll result boolean expression](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnolan/wild-magic-surge-5e/main/images/roll-result-boolean.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnolan/wild-magic-surge-5e/main/images/roll-result-boolean.jpg)

### Auto surge on spell use after Tides of Chaos has been used

When Tides of Chaos is used, any 1st level spell and higher will trigger a surge and restore your Tides of Chaos.

[![Auto surge on spell use after Tides of Chaos has been used](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnolan/wild-magic-surge-5e/main/images/auto-surge-toc.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnolan/wild-magic-surge-5e/main/images/auto-surge-toc.jpg)

### Include/Exclude Spell Filter

Add a RegEx rule to exclude or include specific spells that should trigger a Wild Magic Surge.

For example if you multiclass you can use this to differentiate between sorcerer spells and non sorcerer spells.

Adding a regex rule of `\(S\)` assumes only spells appended with ` (S)` like `Magic Missile (S)` will trigger a Wild Magic Surge check.

If you want to reverse this logic you can choose to tick the `Reverse Regex Filter` option. This is for spells that you don't want to trigger a Wild Magic Surge that are cast from the sorcerer.

Special thanks to [Jakob Huber](https://github.com/gh7531) for this suggestion and Pull Request.

### Play animation on Surge

On a Wild Magic Surge, the token that triggered the Surge will get an animation play. This requires the awesome [Sequencer](https://github.com/fantasycalendar/FoundryVTT-Sequencer) and [JB2A](https://github.com/Jules-Bens-Aa/JB2A_DnD5e) modules to be installed and active.

### Roll for surge on Cantrips

Standard rules are 1st Level and higher to trigger a surge. This also enables it for Cantrips.

### Encounter Statistics Module Integration

Optionally send Wild Magic Surge event to [Encounter Statistics Module](https://github.com/johnnolan/encounter-stats) to track history of surges in your campaign.
